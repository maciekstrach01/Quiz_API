# Quiz

The programme is a simple quiz in Python. It allows the user to participate in a game, testing knowledge based on questions retrieved from an external API. The main functions include displaying the questions, collecting answers from the user, awarding points for correct answers, saving the results to a ranking file and presenting a ranking of the top scores. The programme runs in an infinite loop, allowing the user to repeatedly use the quiz option, view the ranking or terminate the programme.The programme has applied appropriate validation to users' answers in the quiz.
